TranSCEND: Transdiagnostic Subtyping and Classification Efforts in Neurodegenerative Diseases

PIs: [Elie Matar](https://twitter.com/dreliematar) (University of Sydney) and [Neil Oxtoby](https://neiloxtoby.com) ([UCL POND](https://ucl-pond.github.io))

We are working towards differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases using disease progression modelling, starting with Lewy Body disorders and neuroimaging data.

We are organising a symposium at the University of Sydney in November 2024: [Cutting edge tools for unravelling neurodegenerative disease](/symposium).
